## 📜 Game Rules

Each player (you and the computer) selects one of the following options:

- 🐍 **Snake (`s`)** drinks the water → Snake defeats Water
- 💧 **Water (`w`)** damages the gun → Water defeats Gun
- 🔫 **Gun (`g`)** kills the snake → Gun defeats Snake

> If both choices are the same, the round is declared a **draw**.
